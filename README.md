The given problem is that there are images that need classifying in two ways. First, there is the class, which
talks about the object that is in the image, with 15 different classes. Then, there is also the state, which talks
about the type of anomaly that could be in the image, such as bent-wire, hole, etc. There are 49 different states,
and in total, there are 88 different labels that include both pieces of information for each image. An example
of a label would be “tile-good” or “cable-bent wire.” The first part of the prompt is to distinguish between the
classes, then the second part is to distinguish between “good” and “bad” images.
